# Portfolio

Welcome to the personal portfolio repository of Enzo Gaggiotti.

This project demonstrates a modern, modular, and enterprise-grade architecture, with a clear separation between frontend, backend, and technical documentation.

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

```plaintext
Portfolio/
├── frontend/   # Web application (HTML, CSS, JS)
├── backend/    # API, server logic (coming soon)
├── docs/        # Technical documentation (linting, architecture, tests, etc.)
├── README.md   # General overview
```

## 🎯 Philosophy

- **Modularity**: Each part of the project is independent and well documented.
- **Quality**: Strict linting, tests, CI/CD, comprehensive documentation.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG standards, responsive design.
- **Performance**: Optimized for modern web.

## 📚 Documentation

Full technical documentation is available in the `doc/` folder, including:
- Linting and code quality rules
- Architecture guides
- Testing strategies
- Deployment instructions

## 🚀 Getting Started

See the README in the `frontend/` folder to launch the web application.
Backend documentation will be available in `backend/`.
