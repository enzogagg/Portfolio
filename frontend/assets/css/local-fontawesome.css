/*
  Local FontAwesome placeholder CSS

  Purpose:
  - This file is a local placeholder which prevents requests to the Cloudflare CDN
    and avoids third-party cookies being set by cdnjs.cloudflare.com.
  - To fully restore FontAwesome icons, download the FontAwesome Free webfont package
    (CSS + webfonts) and place the files under:
      assets/fonts/fontawesome/css/all.min.css
      assets/fonts/fontawesome/webfonts/*

  If you place the real `all.min.css` and `webfonts/` in that folder, you can replace
  this file or `@import` the real CSS from here.

  Minimal safe fallback: no icons, no external requests. You can later replace
  this with the real FontAwesome CSS to restore icons.
*/

/* No-op placeholder to avoid 3rd-party CDN requests */
/* Add actual FontAwesome files into assets/fonts/fontawesome/ as described above. */

/* Example: if you add the real all.min.css you can forward-import it like this:
   @import url("./all.min.css");
*/

/* Keep a very small font-face stub to avoid CSS errors in some setups (no actual font). */
@font-face {
  font-family: "Font Awesome 6 Free";
  src: local("" );
  font-weight: 400 900;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}

/* No icon class definitions here — this file intentionally does not provide icons.
   To enable icons: download FontAwesome Free and place files as explained above. */
